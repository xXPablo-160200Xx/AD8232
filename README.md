# AD8232
In this repository, you will find the codes to program and process the heart signal from module AD8232.

PLEASE, if you're going to use these codes don't forget to install IDE Arduino from "https://www.arduino.cc/en/software", Python3 or higher from "https://www.python.org/downloads/" and Visual Studio Community from "https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/community/" before using the codes within this project. 

It's important to compile and up the .ino files before using the .py files.
